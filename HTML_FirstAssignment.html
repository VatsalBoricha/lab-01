    <h2>King Of The Kings!!</h2>
    <p>
        I was born in <b>2003</b> in India, Gujarat to be specific which is a lovely place to grow up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Went to school and nailed the grades. Also i passed my high school last year so.. yeah, the <b>COVID</b> batch (Still nailed the grades).
        Then i learnt that schools and exams can be online. Which was not that fun but .. i survived. And then i decided to come to Canada to pursue my higher study and chose the <b><em>legendary</em></b> <u>computer programming</u> course. Also i am confused choosing between Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity.

        Talking about my achievements, i've worked as a part of an event management team and impressed many with my skills. i've also worked in a hiring organization for one day and then quit it cuz i got bored, all this in a single summer vacation. Yeah, that's how kings do it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I have different goals, I want to get the <b>Tech</b> field and conquer it while also having a balanced life where i juice out the fun of life.I know.... sounds a lot hard and fun at the same time. I think that is pretty much it about me.
